The mobile app for ICE Card
===========================

This is made in react native. How to install:

You should have node installed. I recommend
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Then it's as simple as this:

```
$ npm install -g react-native-cli
$ npm i
$ react-native run-android
```

The web server: You'll need one. VPN in to the Exochain network and open
in your browser http://dev-ice.corp.exochain.com:3000/testing-monkey-15/print.
Open the app and scan the QR code. The password for this test card is
`password`.
